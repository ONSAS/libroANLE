@article{Bonet2006,
abstract = {This paper presents a comparative study of different integration methods of stresses (both analytical and numerical) for concrete sections subjected to axial loads and biaxial bending. Such methods are applied to circular and rectangular sections. The constitutive equation used is a parabola-rectangle from the Eurocode-2. The comparison was performed with regard to the accuracy and the computational speed of each method. The objective of the paper is to determine which of the integration methods compared is more efficient in computing the interaction surfaces for rectangular and circular sections. The analytical method proposed by Barros et al. [Barros MHFM, Barros A, Ferreira C. Closed form solution of optimal design of rectangular reinforced concrete sections. Eng Comput 2004;21(7):761–76] for rectangular sections is compared with the numerical method termed “modified thick layer integration” proposed by Bonet et al. [Bonet JL, Romero ML, Miguel PF, Fernandez MA. A fast stress integration algorithm for reinforced concrete sections with axial loads and biaxial bending. Comput Struct 2004;82(2–3):213–25] and with the well-known fiber method. Furthermore, two new methods are proposed for circular sections: one analytical and one numerical based on the Gauss–Legendre quadrature. The results of both methods are compared with the classical layer decomposition method.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a new finite element for Timoshenko beam model that enables a very efficient computation of the ultimate limit load for reinforced concrete frames. The proposed stress-resultant model combines the descriptions of the diffuse plastic failure in the beam and the localized failure with creation of the corresponding plastic hinges representing both bending and shear failure mechanisms. The latter requires introducing the corresponding enhancement of the beam finite element kinematics by using the rotation and displacement discontinuities. Such an enhancement is formulated in the appropriate variational framework with the numerical implementation placed in the framework of incompatible mode method. The proposed model is shown to be capable of enforcing the mesh objectivity of the post-peak response computations. The results of several numerical simulations are given in order to illustrate a very satisfying performance of the proposed methodology for ultimate limit load computation of reinforced concrete frames. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

@book{DeBorst2012,
abstract = {Built upon the two original books by Mike Crisfield and their own lecture notes, renowned scientist Ren{\'{e}} de Borst and his team offer a thoroughly updated yet condensed edition that retains and builds upon the excellent reputation and appeal amongst students and engineers alike for which Crisfield's first edition is acclaimed.Together with numerous additions and updates, the new authors have retained the core content of the original publication, while bringing an improved focus on new developments and ideas. This edition offers the latest insights in non-linear finite element technology, including non-linear solution strategies, computational plasticity, damage mechanics, time-dependent effects, hyperelasticity and large-strain elasto-plasticity.The authors' integrated and consistent style and unrivalled engineering approach assures this book's unique position within the computational mechanics literature.Key features:Combines the two previous volumes into one heavily revised text with obsolete material removed, an improved layout and updated references and notationsExtensive new material on more recent developments in computational mechanicsEasily readable, engineering oriented, with no more details in the main text than necessary to understand the concepts.Pseudo-code throughout makes the link between theory and algorithms, and the actual implementation.Accompanied by a website (www.wiley.com/go/deborst) with a Python code, based on the pseudo-code within the book and suitable for solving small-size problems. Non-linear Finite Element Analysis of Solids and Structures, 2nd Edition is an essential reference for practising engineers and researchers that can also be used as a text for undergraduate and graduate students within computational mechanics.},

@article{Delfino1997,
abstract = {A three-dimensional finite element model of the carotid artery bifurcation was constructed in order to determine the stress field and assess the modification of the stress field when residual strain is taken into account. Residual strain in the carotid bifurcation was characterized by experimental observations. According to these observations, a geometrical model of the carotid artery was constructed to exhibit a state free of strain. Appropriate boundary conditions were applied to yield the correct geometry in the unloaded state, and physiological levels of pressure and axial stretching were applied. The model took into account the varying thickness of the arterial wall along the bifurcation. For modeling purposes, the material was considered to be hyperelastic, incompressible, homogenous and isotropic. For comparison, a similar model of the carotid artery which does not include the effects of residual strain was also created. The results demonstrate that in the model of the carotid artery bifurcation with residual strain, the distribution of maximum principal stress along the inner wall and the circumferential stress throughout the wall is much more uniform than in the model without residual strain. The ratio between the stress at the inner and the outer walls is highest at the lateral wall of the carotid sinus; this is the same location known to be a site of low and oscillatory fluid wall shear stress, and the principal location of early intimal thickening. These results suggest that the localization of atherosclerosis in the carotid artery may be due to local variations in both fluid wall shear stress and solid wall stress.},

abstract = {We reconstruct the in vivo spatial distribution of linear and nonlinear elastic parameters in ten patients with benign (five) and malignant (five) tumors. The mechanical behavior of breast tissue is represented by a modified Veronda-Westmann model with one linear and one nonlinear elastic parameter. The spatial distribution of these elastic parameters is determined by solving an inverse problem within the region of interest (ROI). This inverse problem solution requires the knowledge of the displacement fields at small and large strains. The displacement fields are measured using a free-hand ultrasound strain imaging technique wherein, a linear array ultrasound transducer is positioned on the breast and radio frequency echo signals are recorded within the ROI while the tissue is slowly deformed with the transducer. Incremental displacement fields are determined from successive radio-frequency frames by employing cross-correlation techniques. The rectangular regions of interest were subjectively selected to obtain low noise displacement estimates and therefore were variables that ranged from 346 to 849.6 mm2 . It is observed that malignant tumors stiffen at a faster rate than benign tumors and based on this criterion nine out of ten tumors were correctly classified as being either benign or malignant.},
